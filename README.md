This project evaluates the intersection of predictive modeling and algorithmic ethics within the financial sector. It audits automated credit scoring systems to detect and mitigate demographic biases, ensuring that data-driven lending remains both accurate and equitable.

Technical Implementation:

*SQL: Executes data engineering and extraction from relational databases, utilizing complex aggregations and window functions to structure raw financial histories.

*RStudio: Serves as the analytical core for implementing Logistic Regression models and statistical fairness tests to identify disparities in credit approval rates.

*Excel: Provides a high-level Business Intelligence interface, transforming econometric outputs into interactive dashboards for risk management and "What-if" scenario simulation.

Key Deliverables:

*Relational database schema for financial risk assessment.

*Statistical audit report on algorithmic neutrality.

*Interactive executive dashboard for real-time decision support.
